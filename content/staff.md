I first saw the Gunnison valley in 1972, and except for a twelve year residency in Boulder, Crested Butte has been my forever home.
I have been a ballet dancer and extreme rock climber, a telemark skier, and a bodybuilder.
Backpacking, hiking, and cross country skiing fill my recreational time.
For over forty years as a fitness professional and ballet teacher, learning more effective ways to workout has ignited my passion.
I am excited to continue coaching students of all ages in my Bionic Body Fitness studio.
