I first saw the Gunnison valley in 1972, and except for a twelve year residency in Boulder, Crested Butte has been my forever home.
I have been a ballet dancer and extreme rock climber, a telemark skier, and a bodybuilder.
Backpacking, hiking, and cross country skiing fill my recreational time.
For over forty years as a fitness professional and ballet teacher, learning more effective ways to workout has ignited my passion.
I am excited to continue coaching students of all ages in my Bionic Body Fitness studio.

Calling beautiful Crested Butte home, Meriska brings her passion for building strength, overall fitness and optimal health to Bionic Body Fitness.
Studying through the ISSA and constantly researching the latest in biohacking, her classes combine a wide variety of disciplines.
When sheâ€™s not in the gym, she can be found hiking, trail running, snowboarding, cross country skiing, reading or cooking up a storm.
